//! `domino debug` — solver-guided exploration and claim checking.
//!
//! This is the driver the epic exists for: it symbolically executes the left
//! oracle to every terminal (story 05), and for each left terminal explores the
//! right oracle, asking the solver at every terminal pair whether the pair is
//! reachable and whether the claim goal holds. Failures come back pinned to a
//! concrete, human-readable execution path on both sides.
//!
//! ## Encoding
//!
//! A single **base frame** is asserted once at solver level 0
//! ([`base_frame`]): the same declarations, game definitions, constants,
//! invariants and randomness machinery `prove` uses, except
//! [`EquivalenceContext::emit_constant_declarations`] is narrowed with
//! `Some(oracle)` so `<return-{GI}-{O}>` is left free, and the claim's
//! assumptions are asserted positively up front (story 04). Then, per left path,
//! `push` and assert its flat DSA encoding; per right path, `push` and assert
//! that; check reachability (vacuity); `push` and assert the negated goal; check.
//!
//! ## Branch-level pruning (story 08)
//!
//! Story 05's [`execute_streaming_with_oracle`] consults a [`BranchOracle`] at
//! every fork. [`SolverPruner`] is that oracle: it mirrors the executor's DFS on
//! the solver stack (one `push` per `enter`, one `pop` per `leave`) and answers
//! [`Feasibility::Prune`] for a fork whose prefix is `unsat`.
//!
//! - **Verdicts are decoupled from pruning.** The terminal-pair vacuity check
//!   ([`check_pair`]) is **unconditional** — it is what distinguishes
//!   [`Verdict::Unreachable`] from [`Verdict::Verified`], and it is not tied to
//!   the pruning flags.
//! - `check_left` / `check_right` (both **on** by default, disabled with
//!   `--no-check-left` / `--no-check-right`) only decide whether the
//!   corresponding side's `SolverPruner` actually queries the solver and cuts
//!   subtrees. `--no-check-left --no-check-right` reproduces the un-pruned
//!   full-enumeration behaviour exactly.
//! - **Soundness.** The per-path SMT encoding is a plain conjunction
//!   (`decls ++ constraints ++ return_constraint`), so a branch only adds a
//!   conjunct: `base ∧ prefix` `unsat` ⟹ `base ∧ prefix ∧ rest` `unsat` for
//!   every `rest`. Cutting an `unsat` prefix therefore removes only pairs that
//!   would have been `Unreachable`; it can never hide a [`Verdict::GoalFails`].
//!   The converse fails, so the terminal-pair vacuity check stays. If the
//!   per-path encoding ever stops being a plain conjunction, this breaks.
//! - A per-left-path terminal `check_sat` (gated on `check_left`) additionally
//!   prunes a whole left path whose *terminal* is `unsat` — needed because
//!   `no-abort` and the other claim assumptions only bite once
//!   `return_constraint` lands, which is not part of any branch prefix.
//!
//! Only `unsat` ever prunes. `unknown` and timeouts are always explored.
