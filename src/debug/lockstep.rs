//! Lockstep execution (`docs/stories/easycrypt/23-lockstep-execution.md`).
//!
//! The sequential debugger walks every left path and, under each, every right
//! path. An EasyCrypt pRHL proof instead advances both programs together and
//! decides each branch jointly. [`run_lockstep`] does the same: it owns one
//! executor per side and walks the **joint tree** depth first.
//!
//! # A joint node
//!
//! Each side consumes its straight-line code (assignments, call entry and exit,
//! callee returns) up to its next *decision point*: a branch, a sampling, or
//! the end of the oracle. The two decision points are then resolved by the
//! first rule that fits, with `A` the assumptions on the solver stack and `pc`
//! both sides' path conditions:
//!
//! 1. **Determined branch** ([`NodeKind::Determined`]): a side's condition `c`
//!    has `A ∧ pc ∧ ¬c` or `A ∧ pc ∧ c` unsatisfiable. That side takes the
//!    determined child alone, left before right. If both are unsatisfiable the
//!    node is unreachable ([`NodeKind::Unreachable`]). A done-flag guard (`DoneFlag`)
//!    (condition `true`) always resolves here.
//! 2. **Synchronized branch**: both sides at undetermined branches and
//!    `A ∧ pc ∧ (c_L ≠ c_R)` unsatisfiable: (then, then) and (else, else).
//! 3. **Split**: any other branch situation; every combination of the
//!    outcomes, the unsatisfiable ones pruned. Branches go before samplings.
//! 4. **Samplings**, when neither side is at a branch. Both at samplings with
//!    `A ∧ pc ∧ draw_L ≠ draw_R` unsatisfiable: consume both. Otherwise a side's
//!    head sampling is *independent* when, for every candidate the randomness
//!    mapping could pair it with, the mapping's premise is unsatisfiable under
//!    `A ∧ pc`: consume it alone, left first. Otherwise it is a **stuck point**
//!    ([`StuckPoint`]): recorded, consumed with Domino's semantics (the draw is
//!    still the game's `rand` term, so the mapping keeps constraining it), and
//!    execution goes on. The mapping's text is never read; it may depend on
//!    the state and the arguments.
//! 5. **Terminal pair**: both sides at terminals. After an unconditional
//!    vacuity check, *equal-output* and *invariant* are checked, and, when the
//!    invariant is not verified, each state relation on its own.
//!
//! Only `unsat` prunes; `unknown` is always explored, exactly as in the
//! sequential debugger.
//!
//! # Driving it
//!
//! [`run_lockstep`] reports to a [`LockstepObserver`] in depth-first order, so
//! a consumer (the viewer, the tactic generator of story 27) can act on each
//! node with the solver stack at that node's state. The engine also returns the
//! whole [`LockstepOutcome`]. The tree is an arena, [`JointTree::nodes`], in
//! depth-first pre-order; a node's children point into it.
//!
//! # Identifiers
//!
//! `J<n>` numbers joint paths and `S<n>` stuck points, from 1, in depth-first
//! order (then before else, left before right). They depend on nothing but the
//! project, so an unchanged project gives identical ids.
//!
//! The engine is listing-agnostic: it takes two [`InlinedOracle`]s together
//! with the game instances and sample infos they execute against.
