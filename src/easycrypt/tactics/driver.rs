//! The prover: walks the lockstep joint tree of one oracle depth first, alongside a live
//! EasyCrypt session, and writes down the sentences EasyCrypt accepts (story 27 §3.2-§3.6).
//!
//! **Invariant of the walk.** Every routine that handles "the front goal" leaves the session in
//! the state "that goal is closed and every other goal is as it was": what a tactic produces is
//! handled front to back, each subgoal in its own bullet. A subgoal EasyCrypt could not be
//! made to close is closed with a labelled `admit`. Every attempt runs under `undo`: the
//! session is always "all accepted sentences so far", so the script replays.
//!
//! **Tactics take positions from EasyCrypt** (ADR 0002): the joint tree supplies decisions
//! only. Counts for `sp k l` and the names of sampled variables are read from the JSON of the
//! goal in front, and subgoals are told apart by kind, never by position in a list.
