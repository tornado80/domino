//! `domino easycrypt prove`: proofs from lockstep execution (story 27).
//!
//! For each selected oracle of each equivalence: run lockstep execution on the oracle
//! (`domino debug --easycrypt`'s engine, its artifacts written the same way), then walk the
//! joint tree alongside a live EasyCrypt session ([`driver`]), send each step, read the goals
//! back as JSON, and write down what EasyCrypt accepted as the oracle's bullet in `Eq_*.ec`.
//! What could not be closed is an `admit` labelled with the claim, the invariant relation, the
//! `J`/`S` id and what Domino itself concluded.
//!
//! **The file on disk is what has been proved so far** (story 33): `Eq_*.ec` and its report are
//! rewritten together, atomically, after every oracle (or, with [`WriteGranularity::Node`],
//! after every joint node, or, with [`WriteGranularity::Tactic`], the default, after every accepted
//! sentence, the oracle in flight **sealed**). Nothing compiles the written file
//! during a run (ADR 0005): every sentence in it was accepted by the live session.
//!
//! **Ctrl-C** (story 34, [`TacticsOptions::stop`]) stops the run where it stands: the running
//! EasyCrypt sentence is interrupted, lockstep execution stops at its next node, the oracle in
//! flight is sealed and written, and the result says so ([`Interrupted`]).
//!
//! **An unanswered interrupt** (`SessionError::Unresponsive`: EasyCrypt did not answer the
//! interrupts [`Session::send`] kept sending) seals the oracle in flight like a Ctrl-C, but the
//! job goes on: the stuck EasyCrypt is replaced by a fresh one opened at the same proof (a
//! **respawn**, [`respawn`]), the oracles already in the file are admitted there, and the walk
//! carries on with the next oracle. After [`MAX_RESPAWNS`] respawns the next one ends the job
//! ([`EquivalenceTactics::ended_early`]). An answer that shows EasyCrypt *swallowed* an interrupt
//! is warned about once per run ([`SwallowWatch`]).
//!
//! **Resuming an interrupted oracle** (ADR 0008, [`ResumeMode`]): lockstep execution's joint tree
//! is saved beside the session record (`Eq_<L>_<R>.<oracle>.tree.json`) before the oracle's first
//! sentence. An oracle the record holds as `interrupted` is walked again on that saved tree, its
//! closed nodes kept, instead of being proved from scratch.
//!
//! - [`script`]: the accepted sentences, bullets and indentation.
//! - [`goals`]: reading goals from the JSON.
//! - [`driver`]: the prover.
//! - [`live`], `live::page`: the live translation page, `progress/Eq_<L>_<R>/index.html` (story 28, 36).
//!
//! `domino easycrypt export` never gets here.
