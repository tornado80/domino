//! A live `easycrypt cli -json` process (story 26 §3.1).
//!
//! [`Session::send`] writes one sentence and reads the one JSON line EasyCrypt answers with
//! (`easycrypt/doc/json-output.md`). The state of the session after the sentence is the
//! returned [`Response`]; [`Session::undo_to`] goes back to an earlier one in O(1). Every
//! exchange is kept in [`Session::transcript`]; with a transcript sink it is also written to
//! `ec-transcript.jsonl` as it happens ([`Session::set_transcript_sink`], module [`transcript`]).
//!
//! The binary is found through the `DOMINO_EASYCRYPT` environment variable, falling back to
//! `easycrypt` on `PATH`, and is checked at startup: a binary that does not answer in
//! `domino-json/1` is refused with a message naming the variable and the branch of the
//! EasyCrypt clone that adds the format.
